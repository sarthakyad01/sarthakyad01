### Projects

- [Finding Wildlife Traffickers based on customer transactions at Scotiabank](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/IMI.git): This project aims to detect fraudulent activity among Scotiabank account holders and identify connections to wildlife trafficking. Using LLMs and Machine Learning techniques, the project will flag suspicious transactions and behaviors indicative of fraud. Identified fraudsters will then be cross-referenced with data from law enforcement and wildlife protection agencies to uncover links to wildlife trafficking networks, enhancing anti-fraud measures and contributing to global conservation efforts.

- [Quora Question Pair Similarity](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Quora_Question_Pair_Similarity.git): This project focuses on determining whether questions posted on Quora are duplicates, meaning they essentially seek the same answer. To achieve this, we compared the performance of several advanced machine learning models: Siamese BERT, LSTM, and Sentence Transformer, against the historically used 75% accuracy Random Forest model. The goal was to assess the effectiveness of these models in identifying duplicate questions, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of duplicate detection on the platform.
  
- [Identifying Optimal Spots for Reconstruction and Renovation](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Optimal-Spots-for-Construction-and-Renovation.git): This project aims to improve reconstruction and renovation strategies in Canada by clustering regions using K-Means Clustering based on demographic trends. Using various algorithms such as Decision Trees, SVMs, Regression Models, it identifies median household incomes within these clusters, enabling tailored approaches for reconstruction and renovation that are aligned with income levels.
  
- [IBM Watson Analytics Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Fast-Food-Marketing-Campaign-A-B-Test.git): This project applies the ANOVA test to evaluate the effectiveness of different promotion strategies for a fast-food chain. The goal is to determine which strategies are most suitable for optimizing sales following the introduction of a new menu item. By analyzing the impact of each strategy, the project aims to provide data-driven recommendations to enhance marketing efforts and boost overall sales performance.

- [Market Basket Analysis for Customers at a Mall](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Market-Basket-Analysis.git): This project aims to enhance marketing strategies for a supermarket mall by segmenting customers using K-Means Clustering based on their annual income and spending score. By analyzing customer data, including age, gender, and economic indicators, the project identifies distinct customer groups, facilitating targeted marketing campaigns. Visualizations such as boxplots, histograms, and count plots further delineate the characteristics of each cluster, allowing for more personalized and effective marketing initiatives tailored to specific demographic profiles.
  
- [Carbon Dioxide Emissions by Countries EDA Analysis](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/CO2_Emissions.git): This project involves the application of extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) combined with regression analysis to determine carbon emissions by country and the factors impacting them. Through this analysis, the project aims to identify the major polluting countries and the most significant factors contributing to their emissions. By understanding these key drivers, the project seeks to provide insights for developing targeted strategies to reduce global carbon emissions effectively.
  
- [A/B Testing Sales Team Proposal at a Video Game Company](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/A-B-Testing-Sales-Team-Proposal.git): This project involves optimizing the matching algorithm at a video game company to determine if higher waiting times and lower bot matching can increase in-game ad revenue without deteriorating the user experience. A/B testing was used to evaluate the impact of these changes, aiming to strike a balance between maximizing revenue and maintaining a positive gaming experience for users.

- [Big Mart Sales Prediction](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Big-Mart-Sales.git): This project focuses on predicting the sales of products at Big Mart outlets and to identify the factors influencing sales performance. This involved analyzing historical sales data to develop predictive models that could forecast sales figures based on various store and product attributes. To meet this objective a Decision Tree Model and Boosting Model was employed in R with the Boosting Model ensuring a lower Mean Squared Error as compared to the Decision Tree Model.

- [North American Stock Exchange Analysis](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/North-American-Stock-Exchange-Analysis.git): Utilized SQL to manipulate a relational database for identifying top-performing stocks in North America; employed Window Functions, SQL Joins, and advanced SQL techniques to design and query the database, enhancing strategic financial decision-making.
