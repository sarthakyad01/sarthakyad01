### Projects
- [Finding Wildlife Traffickers based on customer transactions at Scotiabank](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/IMI.git): This project aims to detect fraudulent activity among Scotiabank account holders and identify connections to wildlife trafficking. Using LLMs and Machine Learning techniques, the project will flag suspicious transactions and behaviors indicative of fraud. Identified fraudsters will then be cross-referenced with data from law enforcement and wildlife protection agencies to uncover links to wildlife trafficking networks, enhancing anti-fraud measures and contributing to global conservation efforts.
  
- [Identifying Optimal Spots for Reconstruction and Renovation](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Optimal-Spots-for-Construction-and-Renovation.git): This project aims to improve reconstruction and renovation strategies in Canada by clustering regions using K-Means Clustering based on demographic trends. Using various algorithms such as Decision Trees, SVMs, Regression Models, it identifies median household incomes within these clusters, enabling tailored approaches for reconstruction and renovation that are aligned with income levels.
  
- [IBM Watson Analytics Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Fast-Food-Marketing-Campaign-A-B-Test.git): This project applies the ANOVA test to evaluate the effectiveness of different promotion strategies for a fast-food chain. The goal is to determine which strategies are most suitable for optimizing sales following the introduction of a new menu item. By analyzing the impact of each strategy, the project aims to provide data-driven recommendations to enhance marketing efforts and boost overall sales performance.
  
- [Carbon Dioxide Emissions by Countries EDA Analysis](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/CO2_Emissions.git): This project involves the application of extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) combined with regression analysis to determine carbon emissions by country and the factors impacting them. Through this analysis, the project aims to identify the major polluting countries and the most significant factors contributing to their emissions. By understanding these key drivers, the project seeks to provide insights for developing targeted strategies to reduce global carbon emissions effectively.
  
- [Inflation Data EDA](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Inflation-EDA.git): This project focuses on performing extensive data visualization to evaluate inflation levels across countries from 1980 onwards. The aim is to observe how inflation trends vary by region, identify periods of economic expansion and recession, and uncover patterns and correlations in the data. Through visual analysis, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of global inflation dynamics over the past decades.
  
- [A/B Testing Sales Team Proposal at a Video Game Company](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/A-B-Testing-Sales-Team-Proposal.git): This project involves optimizing the matching algorithm at a video game company to determine if higher waiting times and lower bot matching can increase in-game ad revenue without deteriorating the user experience. A/B testing was used to evaluate the impact of these changes, aiming to strike a balance between maximizing revenue and maintaining a positive gaming experience for users.

- [Quora Question Pair Similarity](https://github.com/sarthakyad01/Quora_Question_Pair_Similarity.git): This project focuses on determining whether questions posted on Quora are duplicates, meaning they essentially seek the same answer. To achieve this, we compared the performance of several advanced machine learning models: Siamese BERT, LSTM, and Sentence Transformer, against the historically used 75% accuracy Random Forest model. The goal was to assess the effectiveness of these models in identifying duplicate questions, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of duplicate detection on the platform.
